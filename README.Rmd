The goal of `moveslite` is to provide fast, highly accurate predictions of emissions tailored to a user's county. `moveslite` achieves this goal by generating predictions from statistical models built off of a vast supply of default emissions estimates for every county in the US generated by the EPA's MOVES software, compiled by the Cornell Climate Action in Transportation Team. While MOVES data is extremely time consuming to generate, `moveslite` builds models that approximate that data to allow for fast comparison of multiple scenarios within seconds. The goal is to enable fast, data-driven decision making using computational methods, built atop the EPA's MOVES model, the gold standard in the US for emissions modeling and regulatory compliance.

## Installation

You can install the development version of movesai from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Gao-Labs/movesai")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(movesai)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
